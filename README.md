Simple Python Calculator -  A simple and interactive command-line calculator built using Python.
                            This program performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on user input. 
                            It is ideal for beginners who are learning fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and input handling.

How It Works ?
            The program shows a list of four math operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
            The user picks one by typing a number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
            Then, the user enters two numbers (called inputs).
            Based on the user’s choice, the program calls the correct function to do the math.
            The result is displayed on the screen (output).
            If the user tries to divide by zero, the program shows an error message instead of crashing.
